# Optimization algorithm for CT image reconstruction
```
1. Use superposition of qubits to make an undetermined CT image.
2. Calculate a sinogram with qubits in superposition by Radon transform from the CT image.
3. Optimizing the sinogram with qubits and a sinogram obtained by an experiment (X-ray or Radon etc.)
