# Optimization algorithm for CT image reconstruction
```
1. CT image of quantum superposition: undetermined CT image
2. Calculation of a superimposed sinogram by Radon transform of the superimposed CT image
3. Optimizing the superimposed sinogram to a sinogram obtained by an experiment (X-ray or Radon etc.)
